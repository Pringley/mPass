        <h1>What <i>is</i> mPass?</h1> 
        
        <p> 
            Simply put, mPass is a manageable way to maintain secure and unique passwords
            for the dozens of web services we use every day. Instead of saving all your
            passwords to your hard drive or trusting them to a third party, though, mPass
            uses the mathematical concept of a <b>one-way function</b> to "remember" your
            passwords.
        </p> 
        
        <p> 
            You start by creating a <b>Master Password</b>&#8212;a single, strong password
            that you need to memorize. Then, each time you sign up for a new web service,
            use the <a href="index.html">mPass script</a> to calculate a brand new password
            by combining your Master Password with the URL of the website. Give the service
            this <b>Site-Specific Password</b>, keeping your Master Password known to
            yourself only.
        </p> 
        
        <p> 
            Whenever you need to log in to a web service, simply revisit the
            <a href="index.html">mPass page</a> to recalculate your password. You
            only have to remember your one Master Password, yet you can still reap the
            benefits of having different passwords for all your web services.
        </p> 
        
        <p> 
            If you use <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, there
            is a (free) mPass extension available at the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chdknmgalfodlikcknjdcakoihkjkpep">Web Store</a>.
        </p> 
        
        <h1>Why should I use it?</h1> 
        
        <p> 
            One of the worst things you can do on the internet is to use the same
            password (or few passwords) on every web service you sign up for. If just
            one of the websites you visit is compromised, then all of the others are
            vulnerable as well.
        </p> 
        
        <p> 
            The solution, of course, is to use different login credentials for each
            different service. In practice, though, this can be hard&#8212;who can remember
            a dozen different passwords? One solution is to use a password management
            program that stores your different passwords either on your hard drive or
            on a web server. Good ones can even cost money.
        </p> 
        
        <p> 
            Instead of storing your passwords somewhere, mPass only calculates them
            when you need them. This way, there's no database that can be compromised,
            making your information that much safer.
        </p>

            Make sure you have Javascript enabled in your browser's options.
        </p> 
        
        <p> 
            Also, keep in mind that mPass is <b>case sensitive</b>. For example,
            "google.com" is different from "Google.com" because of the capital
            letter. If you change the capitalization, you will see a different
            password.
        </p> 
        
        <h1>Can I get some technical details?</h1> 
        
        <p> 
            The mPass script outputs the first ten digits in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64</a> of a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_512">SHA-512</a> 
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> with a "master
            password" as the key and a domain as the message. This means that
            it should be computationally infeasible to determine any site-specific
            password without the master one, even if one or more of the other
            site-specific passwords is compromised. This page calculates the hashes
            using the <a href="http://jssha.sourceforge.net/">jsSHA</a> 
            implementation of SHA-512 in Javascript, so all of the computation
            is done by your browser. (None of your information is sent to the
            server).
