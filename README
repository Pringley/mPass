mPass is a manageable way to maintain secure and unique passwords for the dozens of web services we use every day. Instead of saving all your passwords to your hard drive or trusting them to a third party, though, mPass uses the mathematical concept of a one-way function to "remember" your passwords.

mPass is really more of a specification than an application. It takes a SHA-512 HMAC of a given domain (using a "master password" as the key) and outputs the first ten digits in base 64.
